What it is:
    Speakhael is a simple shell to use espeak in a comfortable way,
     ommitting the repetition of the command symbols.

What it does:
    It opens a shell that receives a userdefined line that gets spoken aloud when confirmed by Enter.
    To speak the text line it relies on the programms espeak and paplay


Original purpose:
    I created the script to solve a practical problem:
    When a friend of mine became sick and could not talk to me, 
    I started to write this script enabling to type in what should be spoken aloud.
    Since in conversations there are several interactive statements involved, 
    the original espeak command with configurations symbols should haven been repeated every time.
    Now the time to write and have the computer speak out is much shorter.
